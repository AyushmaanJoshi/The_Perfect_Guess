## 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

This is a simple **number guessing game** built in Python where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The program provides hints if the guess is too high or too low and continues until the user guesses correctly.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
```
- The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 10.
- The user is repeatedly prompted to guess the number.
- The program gives feedback:
  - If the guess is too high → "Kindly decrease the number"
  - If the guess is too low → "Kindly increase the number"
  - If the guess is correct → Congratulates the user and ends the game
```
